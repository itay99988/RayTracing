# Ray Tracing Program

## Main purpose 
The program's purpose is to render an image from a 3d model which decribes objects in the 3d space. This program uses a technique called ray tracing. The technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism, but in some cases it requires a relatively high computational cost.

## What does it look like?
Below are some of the program outputs:

  <img src="./images/spheres.png" alt="spheres example"

</p>
